It's been a while since this blog was written, and there are a lot of
developments in the life of the Taipei Hackerspace. Finally we are a
real "space", having rented out a nice little 37 ping (~130 sq. m)
appartment/office space, where we get access to a same sized roof
as well.

You can see how it looked when we got it on [this album][emptyspace].

Since then the place have seen a lot of donated furniture and tools,
activities, people start to work on their projects. We had our first
Open House, which got more people in, even if the place is open all
other times as well.

The address is 太原路133巷26號4樓 / Taiyuan Rd, Lane 133, No 26, 4th Floor,
or here's it on the [Google Maps][gmaps]. Can ring +886-2-2550-7630 any
time to see if anyone's there, and come by if there is.

There are quite a few interesting projects goig on already:

* Wireless Facebook like count display
* Sous vide machine
* Big bunch of LED works
* Aquaponics
* Robotics
* Getting traffic and song list data from FM with Software Defined Radios (SDR)
* DIY Radio telescope, and lab equipment

You can find more information on [website][website], the [Facebook][fb]
and [Google+][gplus] pages, and the [mailing list][mail]. The code written
for the projects will likely be in the [Github repo][github] for the 'space.

Also thinking about doing a few training courses in programming, electronics,
mechanical desig, photography, or whatever knowledge people would like to contribute.

So, what would **you** like to do?
